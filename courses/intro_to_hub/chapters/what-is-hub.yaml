  Prompt: "What do you think Hub is all about? Dont be afraid to get it wrong."
  Options:
    - A Dataset Streaming package for Optimized ML Pipelining
    - The central part of a wheel, from which the spokes radiate.
    - The effective centre of an activity, region, or network.
    - A network device that broadcasts data to every connected node.
  Answer: A Dataset Streaming package for Optimized ML Pipelining
  Hint: "Pssst! Its a Dataset Streaming Package."

  Prompt: "Hub is The fastest way to store, access & manage datasets with version-control for PyTorch/TensorFlow."

- Category: mcq
  Prompt: "Experience tells us that fast and large dont go together very well, how large databases do you think can be stored using hub?"
  Options:
    - Gigabyte Scale Datasets
    - Terabyte Scale Datasets
    - Petabyte Scale Datasets
  Answer: Petabyte Scale Datasets
  Hint: Aim larger. Hub is amazing at storing large Datasets.

  Prompt: "So it would appear, for Hub, large and fast do go together. That's pretty neat if you ask me."

  Prompt: "But storing a database locally has lots of perks! It allows us to visualize the data whenever we want! How would Hub even do that? Right?"

- Category: text
  Prompt: "I've got you covered, well technically Hub has. Just hop onto their website at 'app.activeloop.ai', and there you can easily visualize your data."
